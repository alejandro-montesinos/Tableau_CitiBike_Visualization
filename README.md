# UC Berkeley Extension Data Analytics Program
## Tableau Exercise
### Task: CitiBike

## Summary 

In this task I analyze data from New York’s bicycle sharing system bicycle sharing system CitiBike, the largest bike sharing program in the united States. 

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program’s utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the CitiBike Data webpage.

The goal of this task is to implement a data visualization dashboard reporting process using the software Tableau and Citibike’s public data. The Tableau dashboard presents analysis on trip trends and bike utilization breakdown by demographic characteristics of the users.

## Data

In this exercise I use public data from CitiBike. Due to the amount of data I only use data from the month of March 2016. The data contains 919,922 records each corresponding to a trip. Data on start and end station, trip duration, time and date and some demographic data of the travelers is available for each record.


## Results and Conclusions

A summary of the results is presented in the form of slides in the file <CitiBike_Results.pptx>. Additionally, the Tableau file <CitiBike_Tableau.twbx> containing the data visualization dashboard is available in this repository.

Some of the findings suggest that while the number of trips by start stations seem to be scattered throughout NYC. The end stations with the most number of trip are concentrated in the Midtown area. 

Most CitiBike users are male (69%) than female (21%), yet women record slightly higher travel time than men.

Peak hours occur during weekdays at 8AM and between 5 and 6PM. This pattern disappears on weekends where most activity is around 2PM on Saturdays and around 5PM on Sundays
